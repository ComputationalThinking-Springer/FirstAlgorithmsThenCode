# Computational Thinking - First Algorithms, Then Code

Python 2.7 implementations of the algorithms described in the book "Computational Thinking - First Algorithms, Then Code" of <a href="http://pages.di.unipi.it/ferragina/">Paolo Ferragina</a> and <a href="http://pages.di.unipi.it/luccio/">Fabrizio Luccio</a>, edit by Springer (2018).

The source codes of these algorithms are contained in the directories **dir_X_titles**, with a clear reference to the corresponding chapter. They are divided by files and the name of the file matches the name of the correspondic pseudo-code in the book. 
All these files are also collected in the compressed file *ComputationalThinking.tar.gz*.

The algorithms can be run on the online page https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php, see the tutorial for more information *Tutorial Python Online.pdf*

There is also a quickest way to run the algorithms. Just copy and past the code you want to runin the *main.py* page and click the button *Execute* (upper left), the result will appear in the virtual *terminal* (lower). This mode odes nto work when the algorithm is importing other algorithms using the keyword *import* (few examples in the book). You can use this mode by doing cut and past of both the desired algorithm and the content of the import file into *main.py*.  

You can run the algorithms also on your computer by downloading the software Anaconda with Python 2.7 form the link https://www.continuum.io/downloads. More details in the tutorial *Tutorial Anaconda.pdf*

The authors thank <a href="http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/riccardo-guidotti">Riccardo Guidotti</a> for the realization of this web page and the implementation of the Python algorithms.
